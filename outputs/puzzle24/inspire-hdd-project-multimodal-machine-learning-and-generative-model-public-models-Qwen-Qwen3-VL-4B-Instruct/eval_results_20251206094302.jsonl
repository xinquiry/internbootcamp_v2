Can we make 1 from 4 and 4? 4/4 = 1. Perfect!\n\nSo: 5 * 5 - (4 / 4) = 25 - 1 = 24.\n\nWe used: 5, 5, 4, 4 — all once.\n\nOperators: *, -, / — all allowed.\n\nSo the expression is: 5 * 5 - 4 / 4\n\nBut we must be careful with order of operations. Division and multiplication have same precedence and are left to right.\n\nSo: 5 * 5 = 25, then 4 / 4 = 1, then 25 - 1 = 24. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid ambiguity, we can write it as: (5 * 5) - (4 / 4)\n\nBut the problem doesn’t require parentheses, and since multiplication and division have same precedence, left to right, but in this case, 5 * 5 - 4 / 4 would be evaluated as:\n\n(5 * 5) - (4 / 4) = 25 - 1 = 24 — because multiplication and division are left to right, and subtraction is lower precedence.\n\nActually, in standard order of operations, multiplication and division are done left to right, and subtraction is done left to right too, but since multiplication and division have higher precedence than subtraction, we can write:\n\n5 * 5 - 4 / 4 → is interpreted as (5 * 5) - (4 / 4) — because * and / have higher precedence than -.\n\nSo it’s safe.\n\nBut to be extra safe, we can write it with parentheses.\n\nHowever, the problem says “you can use the operators +, -, *, /” — doesn’t say we must use parentheses.

Actually, multiplication has precedence, so:\n\n6 - 1 * 4 + 4 → that would be 6 - 4 + 4 = 6 → wrong.\n\nSo we need parentheses.\n\nAlternatively: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4 → same thing.\n\nWe can write: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4\n\nThat’s valid.\n\nLet’s confirm:\n\n4 * (6 - 1) = 4 * 5 = 20\n\n20 + 4 = 24.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnswer: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4\n\nBut note: the problem says \"you can use the operators +, -, *, /\" — we used all of them? We used *, -, + — yes.\n\nWe used all numbers: 4, 6, 1, 4 — yes.\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother possible solution: 6 * 4 = 24, then 4 - 4 = 0, but we need to use 1. So maybe 6 * 4 + (4 - 4) * 1 → 24 + 0 = 24 — but that uses 1, and we have two 4s — wait, we have two 4s, so we can do:\n\n6 * 4 + (4 - 4) * 1 → but that’s 24 + 0 * 1 = 24 — but we’re using 4, 4, 4? No — we only have two 4s.\n\nWait: 6 * 4 → uses one 4\n\n(4 - 4) → uses two 4s — that’s three 4s — not allowed.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nSo the first solution is better.\n\nAnother idea: (4 + 4) * (6 - 1) = 8 * 5 = 40 — too big.\n\nOr (4 * 6) * 1 + 4 → 24 + 4 = 28 — too big.\n\n(4 * 6) + (4 * 1) = 24 + 4 = 28 — no.\n\n(4 + 4) * 3 — but no 3.\n\nWait — 6 / (1/4) = 24 — but we have two 4s.\n\nWait: 6 / (1/4) = 24 → that uses 6, 1, 4 — but we have another 4.\n\nSo 6 / (1/4) * 1? No — we don’t have two 1s.\n\nWait — we can do: 6 / (1/4) = 24, then multiply by 1? But we have a second 4 — not 1.\n\nUnless we do: 6 / (1/4) * (4/4) — but that uses two 4s — 4 and 4 — and 1 — and 6.\n\nLet’s check: 6 / (1/4) = 24\n\nThen * (4/4) = *1 → 24 * 1 = 24.\n\nPerfect.\n\nExpression: 6 / (1/4) * (4/4)\n\nBut we have two 4s — yes.\n\nAnd we used 6, 1, 4, 4 — all once.\n\nOperators: /, *, / — which are allowed.\n\nBut note: we can write it as 6 / (1/4) * (4/4)\n\nBut we can also simplify: 6 / (1/4) = 6 * 4 = 24, and 4/4 = 1, so 24 * 1 = 24.\n\nSo this is also valid.\n\nBut is this acceptable? The problem doesn’t say we can’t use parentheses or fractions — we can use / for division, and fractions are allowed as long as we write them as expressions.\n\nSo both solutions are valid.\n\nBut perhaps the first one is simpler.\n\nLet me see if we can write it without extra parentheses? Not really — multiplication and division have precedence, but we need to group.\n\nBut in the expression 4 * (6 - 1) + 4 — that’s fine.\n\nAnother solution: (6 + 6) * 2 — but we don’t have two 6s.\n\nWait — no.\n\nSo I think both are valid.\n\nBut let’s pick the first one: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4\n\nWe can also write: (6 - 1) * 4 + 4 — same thing.\n\nI think that’s fine.\n\nAnswer: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4\n\nBut let me confirm the order: multiplication first, then addition.\n\n(6 - 1) = 5\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n20 + 4 = 24 — correct.\n\nWe used 6, 1, 4, 4 — all once.\n\nOperators: *, -, + — all allowed.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnswer: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4\n\nBut the problem says “you can use the operators +, -, *, /” — we used +, -, * — yes.\n\nSo final answer.\n\nAnswer: 4 * (6 - 1) + 4\n", "prompt_tokens": 102, "global_seq_tokens": 1657, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 1555, "total_tokens": 1657}, "evaluation_config": {"model": "/inspire/hdd/project/multimodal-machine-learning-and-generative-model/public/models/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct", "api_extra_params": {}, "api_extra_headers": {}, "max_assistant_turns": null, "max_user_turns": null}}

That’s too straightforward — but let’s check: 10 + 8 + 5 + 1 = 24. That uses all numbers once, and only +.\n\nWait — is that allowed? The problem says “you can use the operators +, -, *, /” — doesn’t say you can’t use multiple +.

No — the first 6 is one, the 6 in (6 - 3) is another, and the +6 is a third 6 — so we have three 6s, but we only have two 6s.\n\nMistake.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nSo 6 * (6 - 3 + 1) — that’s 6, 6, 3, 1 — correct.\n\n6 - 3 + 1 = 4, 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nExpression: 6 * (6 - 3 + 1)\n\nThis is also valid.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nBut perhaps the first one is simpler.\n\nWait — 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 — uses multiplication and addition, no parentheses.\n\n6 * (6 - 3 + 1) — uses parentheses.\n\nSince the problem doesn’t restrict parentheses, both are acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if the expression 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 is unambiguous — yes.\n\nAnother way: (6 + 6) * 2 — but no 2.\n\nOr 3 * 6 + 6 * 1 — same as above.\n\nI think 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 is fine.\n\nBut to be safe, let’s use the one with parentheses: 6 * (6 - 3 + 1)\n\nWait — 6 - 3 + 1 — is that 4? Yes, because subtraction and addition have same precedence, left to right.\n\nSo 6 - 3 = 3, then 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nThen 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd we used 6, 6, 3, 1.\n\nSo that’s valid.\n\nWe can also write: 6 * (6 - 3 + 1)\n\nBut in the expression, we must use each number once — yes.\n\nNow, is there a way to write it without parentheses? 6 * 6 - 3 + 1 = 36 - 3 + 1 = 34 — wrong.\n\nSo parentheses are needed if we want to group 6 - 3 + 1.\n\nBut in 6 * (6 - 3 + 1), it’s fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: (6 * 6) - (3 * 1) — 36 - 3 = 33 — no.\n\nNot working.\n\nSo I think 6 * (6 - 3 + 1) is a good expression.\n\nBut let me check if 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 is better — no parentheses, but it’s the same numbers.\n\nActually, both are valid.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects a specific format.\n\nSince the instruction says “arithmetic expression” and doesn’t mention parentheses, and multiplication has precedence, 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 should be acceptable.\n\nBut to be safe, I’ll go with the one that uses parentheses to make it clear.\n\nWait — in 6 * (6 - 3 + 1), the expression is clear.\n\nAnother idea: 6 * 6 / (3 / 2) — but we don’t have 2.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I’ll go with 6 * (6 - 3 + 1)\n\nBut let me verify the order: 6 - 3 + 1 = 4, then 6 * 4 = 24 — yes.\n\nAnd we used 1, 3, 6, 6 — each once.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnswer: 6 * (6 - 3 + 1)\n\nBut wait — is there a way to write it without parentheses? For example, 6 * 6 - 3 + 1 — no, that’s 34.\n\nUnless we do (6 * 6) - (3 + 1) — 36 - 4 = 32 — no.\n\nSo parentheses are necessary.\n\nBut in 6 * (6 - 3 + 1), it’s fine.\n\nAnother expression: (6 + 6) * 2 — no 2.\n\nOr 3 * (6 + 2) — no 2.\n\nNot working.\n\nSo I think 6 * (6 - 3 + 1) is good.\n\nBut let me see if I can write it as 6 * 6 - 3 + 1 — no, that’s 34.\n\nUnless we do 6 * 6 - 3 - 1 — 36 - 3 - 1 = 32 — no.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I’ll use: 6 * (6 - 3 + 1)\n\nBut I just thought — 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 — also works, and doesn’t require parentheses.\n\nPerhaps that’s simpler.\n\nLet me check the expression: 6 * 3 + 6 * 1\n\nIn standard order of operations, multiplication before addition, so 6*3=18, 6*1=6, 18+6=24.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd no parentheses needed.\n\nSo I think that’s better.\n\nFinal decision: 6 * 3 + 6 * 1\n\nAnswer: 6 * 3 + 6 * 1\n\nBut let me write it clearly.\n\nWe can also write it as 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 — same.\n\nI think that’s fine.\n\nAnother way: 3 * 6 + 6 * 1 — same thing.\n\nBut 6 * 3 + 6 * 1 is fine.\n\nSo I’ll go with that.\n\nAnswer: 6 * 3 + 6 * 1\n\nBut wait — is there any ambiguity? No.\n\nSo final answer.\n\nAnswer: 6 * 3 + 6 * 1\n", "prompt_tokens": 102, "global_seq_tokens": 2825, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 2723, "total_tokens": 2825}, "evaluation_config": {"model": "/inspire/hdd/project/multimodal-machine-learning-and-generative-model/public/models/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct", "api_extra_params": {}, "api_extra_headers": {}, "max_assistant_turns": null, "max_user_turns": null}}

That works!\n\nBut let’s check the expression: (9 + 9) + 8 - 2\n\nWe can write it without parentheses if order of operations holds, but to be safe, we can use parentheses to clarify.\n\nActually, addition and subtraction are left-associative, so 9 + 9 + 8 - 2 = 24.\n\nLet’s compute step by step:\n\n9 + 9 = 18\n\n18 + 8 = 26\n\n26 - 2 = 24 ✅\n\nSo: 9 + 9 + 8 - 2 = 24\n\nWe used each number once: 9, 9, 8, 2.\n\nOperators used: +, +, - — all allowed.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnswer: 9 + 9 + 8 - 2\n", "prompt_tokens": 102, "global_seq_tokens": 421, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 421}, "evaluation_config": {"model": "/inspire/hdd/project/multimodal-machine-learning-and-generative-model/public/models/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct", "api_extra_params": {}, "api_extra_headers": {}, "max_assistant_turns": null, "max_user_turns": null}}

But we only have one 2 and we’ve used three 3s — that’s four numbers total, but we have to use 3,3,2,3 — that’s four numbers, so that’s okay.\n\nWait — 3 * 3 * 3 = 27, and we have one 2 left. 27 - 3 = 24, but we already used all three 3s — we don’t have a fourth 3 to subtract. We have only three 3s total.\n\nWait — we have three 3s and one 2 — so four numbers. We can’t use 3 * 3 * 3 and then subtract 3 because we don’t have a fourth 3.\n\nAlternative: (3 + 3) * 3 = 18, then + 6? But we don’t have a 6. We have a 2 left. 18 + 6 = 24, but how to get 6 from 2? Not directly.\n\nWhat if we do: (3 * 2) * (3 + 3) = 6 * 6 = 36 — too big.\n\nTry: 3 * (3 + 3) + 3 * 2? That’s 3*6 + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24. But that uses 3,3,3,2 — yes! Let’s check:\n\n3 * (3 + 3) = 3 * 6 = 18\n\nThen + (3 * 2) = +6 → 18 + 6 = 24\n\nBut we used three 3s and one 2 — perfect.\n\nWait, but we used 3 * (3 + 3) — that’s two 3s and one 3? No — 3 + 3 uses two 3s, then multiplied by another 3 — so three 3s total. Then we have 3 * 2 — that’s another 3 and a 2 — so total three 3s and one 2 — perfect.\n\nBut in the expression: 3 * (3 + 3) + 3 * 2 — that’s four numbers: 3, 3, 3, 2 — yes.\n\nBut is this valid? Let’s compute:\n\nFirst, 3 + 3 = 6\n\nThen 3 * 6 = 18\n\nThen 3 * 2 = 6\n\nThen 18 + 6 = 24 — correct.\n\nBut we must write it as a single expression without parentheses? No — parentheses are allowed, as long as we don’t add extra operators.\n\nThe problem doesn’t restrict parentheses, so this is fine.\n\nBut let’s write it clearly: 3 * (3 + 3) + 3 * 2\n\nBut wait — is this using each number once?

We must use each exactly once, and only +, -, *, / to make 24.\n\nLet’s try to think creatively.\n\nOne idea: 7 * 4 = 28. Then 28 - 6 = 22, and 22 + 7 = 29 — too high.\n\nWhat if we try (7 - 4) = 3, then 6 * 3 = 18, and 18 + 7 = 25 — close.\n\nWhat if we do 7 + 7 = 14, 14 + 6 = 20, 20 + 4 = 24 — that’s 24! But we used 7, 7, 6, 4 — that’s all four numbers.\n\nWait — 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 24? Let’s compute: 7+7=14, 14+6=20, 20+4=24. Yes!\n\nBut is that allowed? The problem says \"you can use the operators +, -, *, /\", and addition is allowed. So we can just add them all.\n\nBut let me double-check: 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 24 — yes, that’s correct.\n\nSo the expression is: 7 + 7 + 6 + 4\n\nBut is this acceptable? The problem doesn’t say we must use multiplication or division — just that we can use +, -, *, / — so addition is fine.\n\nHowever, sometimes puzzles like this require using all four numbers in a single expression with operators, and possibly not just adding. But the problem doesn’t specify that we must use * or / — just that we can use them. So addition is allowed.\n\nBut let me check if there’s a more “interesting” solution, just to be thorough.\n\nAnother idea: (7 - 4) = 3, then 6 * 4 = 24 — but we already used 4.\n\nWait — what if we do (7 * 4) - (7 + 6)? That’s 28 - 13 = 15 — no.\n\nWhat about 6 * 4 = 24, then we have 7 and 7 left — we must use them. So we need to incorporate them in a way that doesn’t change the value — like multiplying by 1 or adding 0.\n\nFor example: (6 * 4) + (7 - 7) = 24 + 0 = 24. That works!\n\nSo: 6 * 4 + (7 - 7)\n\nWe used all numbers: 6, 4, 7, 7 — each once.\n\nOperators: *, +, - — all allowed.\n\nThat’s a valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, we could do (7 - 7) * 6 + 4 — that’s 0 * 6 + 4 = 4 — no.\n\nOr (7 - 7) + 6 * 4 — same as above, 0 + 24 = 24 — yes.\n\nSo: (7 - 7) + 6 * 4\n\nBut order of operations: multiplication before addition — so 6 * 4 = 24, then + 0 = 24.\n\nSo that’s also valid.\n\nWe can write it as: 6 * 4 + (7 - 7)\n\nOr even: (7 - 7) + 6 * 4\n\nBut to be safe, let’s write it with parentheses to avoid ambiguity.\n\nActually, without parentheses, 6 * 4 + 7 - 7 — that would be 24 + 7 - 7 = 24 — that’s also valid!\n\nBecause multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction, so:\n\n6 * 4 + 7 - 7 = 24 + 7 - 7 = 24\n\nSo: 6 * 4 + 7 - 7\n\nThat uses all numbers: 6, 4, 7, 7 — each once.\n\nOperators: *, +, - — all allowed.\n\nAnd evaluates to 24.\n\nEven simpler: 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 — also 24.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a more complex expression? The problem doesn’t specify, so both are valid.\n\nHowever, let’s check if the problem allows using all four numbers in a single expression with operators — yes, and both expressions are valid.\n\nBut maybe we should pick one.\n\nThe expression 6 * 4 + 7 - 7 is clean and uses all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 is also clean.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to use the numbers in a more “non-trivial” way? But it doesn’t specify.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nLet me check if 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 is acceptable — yes, because the problem doesn’t say we must use multiplication or division.\n\nSo I’ll go with that.\n\nBut wait — in the expression 7 + 7 + 6 + 4, we are just adding — no parentheses needed.\n\nBut to be safe, I can use the subtraction trick.\n\nActually, let me see if the problem has any constraint I missed.\n\n“Make 24 using 6, 7, 7, 4. You can only use each number once. You can use the operators +, -, *, /.”\n\nNo constraint on needing to use all operators — so simple addition is fine.\n\nBut let me see if there’s a more elegant solution.\n\nAnother idea: (7 * 4) - (7 + 6) = 28 - 13 = 15 — no.\n\n(7 + 4) * (7 - 6) = 11 * 1 = 11 — no.\n\n(6 - 4) * (7 + 7) = 2 * 14 = 28 — no.\n\n(7 * 6) - (7 + 4) = 42 - 11 = 31 — no.\n\nWait — what about (7 + 7) * (4 - 6/6) — but we don’t have two 6s.\n\nWe have only one 6.\n\nAnother idea: 7 * (4 - 6/6) — but we don’t have two 6s.\n\nWe have one 6.\n\nWait — 6/6 is not possible — we only have one 6.\n\nSo back to the valid ones.\n\nI think 7 + 7 + 6 + 4 is perfectly acceptable.\n\nBut let me check the answer format — it says “arithmetic expression”, and “do not include the target number”.\n\nSo I’ll write: 7 + 7 + 6 + 4\n\nBut to be safe, I’ll also consider the expression 6 * 4 + 7 - 7 — which also works.\n\nActually, 6 * 4 + 7 - 7 is 24 + 7 - 7 = 24 — yes.\n\nBut 7 - 7 is 0, so it’s fine.\n\nI think both are correct.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the expression to be more complex — but it doesn’t say.\n\nI’ll go with the addition one — it’s straightforward.\n\nAnswer: 7 + 7 + 6 + 4\n\nBut wait — let me confirm: 7 + 7 = 14, 14 + 6 = 20, 20 + 4 = 24 — yes.\n\nPerfect.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nAnswer: 7 + 7 + 6 + 4", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": [], "reasoning_content": null}], "extracted_output": "7 + 7 + 6 + 4", "ground_truth": {"numbers": [6, 7, 7, 4], "answer": "4*(6 - 7 + 7)", "operators": ["+", "-", "*", "/"], "difficulty": {"value": [1, 10]}}, "score": 1.0, "reached_max_turns": false, "turn_record": {"interaction_turn_0": {"assistant_turns": 1, "tool_calls_executed": 0}}, "success": true, "full_context": "User:\nMake 24 using 6, 7, 7, 4.

We must use each exactly once and combine them with +, -, *, / to make 24.\n\nLet’s think strategically.\n\nWe need to get to 24. Since 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication might be key.\n\nTry: (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) = 8 * 3 = 24 → That’s 8 * 3 = 24. But we used 4, 4, 2, 1 — all numbers once.

We can write: (4 + 4) * (2 + 1)\n\nThat uses all numbers: two 4s, one 2, one 1.\n\nOperators used: + and *\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnswer: (4 + 4) * (2 + 1)\n\nBut let’s check if the problem allows parentheses — yes, it doesn’t say we can’t use them.\n\nAlternatively, we could write it without parentheses if order of operations would work, but (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) is unambiguous.\n\nAnother way: 4 * (4 + 2 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28 — too big.\n\nOr 4 * (2 + 4) - 4? That’s 4*6 - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 — no.\n\nOr (4 * 4) + (2 * 1) = 16 + 2 = 18 — no.\n\nOr (4 + 2) * 4 - 1? 6 * 4 = 24 - 1 = 23 — no.\n\nWait — what about 4 * (2 + 4) = 24? But that’s 4 * 6 = 24 — but we have only one 4 left? Wait, we have two 4s.\n\nIn 4 * (2 + 4) — we used one 4 and the other 4? Wait — we have two 4s, so we can use both.\n\nWait — in 4 * (2 + 4) — we used two 4s? No — one 4 is multiplied, and the other 4 is inside the parentheses. So yes — we used both 4s, plus 2. But we have a 1 left unused. That’s invalid.\n\nSo we must use all four numbers: 2, 4, 1, 4.\n\nSo (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) = 8 * 3 = 24 — uses all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, (4 * 4) + (2 * 1) = 16 + 2 = 18 — no.\n\n(4 * 4) * 1 + 2? 16 + 2 = 18 — no.\n\n(4 + 4) * 2 * 1 = 8 * 2 * 1 = 16 — no.\n\nWhat about 4 * (4 + 2) * 1? 4 * 6 * 1 = 24 — but we have two 4s? Wait — we used one 4 in multiplication, and another 4 in (4+2) — so that’s two 4s, plus 2, plus 1 — yes! That’s 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 = 4 * 6 * 1 = 24.\n\nBut we have to write it as an expression.\n\nIs that valid? Let’s check: numbers used: 4, 4, 2, 1 — yes.\n\nOperators: *, +, *\n\nSo: 4 * (4 + 2) * 1\n\nBut multiplication is associative, so we can write it as 4 * 4 * 2 * 1? That’s 32 — no.\n\nBut 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 = 4 * 6 * 1 = 24 — correct.\n\nBut is the order of operations clear? Without parentheses, 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 — not 24.\n\nSo we need parentheses: 4 * (4 + 2) * 1\n\nBut we have a 1 — so we’re multiplying by 1, which is fine.\n\nBut we can also write it as (4 * (4 + 2)) * 1 — same thing.\n\nAlternatively, (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) is also fine.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut let’s see if we can avoid the 1? No, we must use 1.\n\nAnother idea: (4 - 1) * (4 + 2) = 3 * 6 = 18 — no.\n\n(4 * 1) * (4 + 2) = 4 * 6 = 24 — again, we used 4, 1, 4, 2 — all numbers.\n\nWait — that’s: (4 * 1) * (4 + 2)\n\nBut 4 * 1 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nBut we have two 4s — one in the first 4, one in the (4+2). So yes.\n\nWe can write: (4 * 1) * (4 + 2)\n\nBut that’s 4 * 1 * 4 + 2? No — without parentheses, 4 * 1 * 4 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 — wrong.\n\nSo we need parentheses: (4 * 1) * (4 + 2)\n\nBut (4 * 1) * (4 + 2) = 4 * 6 = 24 — correct.\n\nAlternatively, 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 — same thing.\n\nActually, 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 is the same as (4 * (4 + 2)) * 1 — multiplication is associative, so we can write it as 4 * 4 * 2 * 1? No, that’s 32.\n\nSo we must use parentheses to group the 4+2.\n\nBut 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 is acceptable.\n\nBut let’s compare with (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) — also acceptable.\n\nWhich one is better?

No — we must use 1.\n\nSo we must include it.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid multiplying by 1?

Perfect!\n\nWait — (4 + 4) = 8, (2 + 1) = 3 → 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nBut we must write it as a single expression. We can write: (4 + 4) * (2 + 1)\n\nThat uses all numbers: two 4s, one 2, one 1.\n\nOperators used: + and *\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnswer: (4 + 4) * (2 + 1)\n\nBut let’s check if the problem allows parentheses — yes, it doesn’t say we can’t use them.\n\nAlternatively, we could write it without parentheses if order of operations would work, but (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) is unambiguous.\n\nAnother way: 4 * (4 + 2 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28 — too big.\n\nOr 4 * (2 + 4) - 4? That’s 4*6 - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 — no.\n\nOr (4 * 4) + (2 * 1) = 16 + 2 = 18 — no.\n\nOr (4 + 2) * 4 - 1? 6 * 4 = 24 - 1 = 23 — no.\n\nWait — what about 4 * (2 + 4) = 24? But that’s 4 * 6 = 24 — but we have only one 4 left? Wait, we have two 4s.\n\nIn 4 * (2 + 4) — we used one 4 and the other 4? Wait — we have two 4s, so we can use both.\n\nWait — in 4 * (2 + 4) — we used two 4s? No — one 4 is multiplied, and the other 4 is inside the parentheses. So yes — we used both 4s, plus 2. But we have a 1 left unused. That’s invalid.\n\nSo we must use all four numbers: 2, 4, 1, 4.\n\nSo (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) = 8 * 3 = 24 — uses all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, (4 * 4) + (2 * 1) = 16 + 2 = 18 — no.\n\n(4 * 4) * 1 + 2? 16 + 2 = 18 — no.\n\n(4 + 4) * 2 * 1 = 8 * 2 * 1 = 16 — no.\n\nWhat about 4 * (4 + 2) * 1? 4 * 6 * 1 = 24 — but we have two 4s? Wait — we used one 4 in multiplication, and another 4 in (4+2) — so that’s two 4s, plus 2, plus 1 — yes! That’s 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 = 4 * 6 * 1 = 24.\n\nBut we have to write it as an expression.\n\nIs that valid? Let’s check: numbers used: 4, 4, 2, 1 — yes.\n\nOperators: *, +, *\n\nSo: 4 * (4 + 2) * 1\n\nBut multiplication is associative, so we can write it as 4 * 4 * 2 * 1? That’s 32 — no.\n\nBut 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 = 4 * 6 * 1 = 24 — correct.\n\nBut is the order of operations clear? Without parentheses, 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 — not 24.\n\nSo we need parentheses: 4 * (4 + 2) * 1\n\nBut we have a 1 — so we’re multiplying by 1, which is fine.\n\nBut we can also write it as (4 * (4 + 2)) * 1 — same thing.\n\nAlternatively, (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) is also fine.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut let’s see if we can avoid the 1? No, we must use 1.\n\nAnother idea: (4 - 1) * (4 + 2) = 3 * 6 = 18 — no.\n\n(4 * 1) * (4 + 2) = 4 * 6 = 24 — again, we used 4, 1, 4, 2 — all numbers.\n\nWait — that’s: (4 * 1) * (4 + 2)\n\nBut 4 * 1 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nBut we have two 4s — one in the first 4, one in the (4+2). So yes.\n\nWe can write: (4 * 1) * (4 + 2)\n\nBut that’s 4 * 1 * 4 + 2? No — without parentheses, 4 * 1 * 4 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 — wrong.\n\nSo we need parentheses: (4 * 1) * (4 + 2)\n\nBut (4 * 1) * (4 + 2) = 4 * 6 = 24 — correct.\n\nAlternatively, 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 — same thing.\n\nActually, 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 is the same as (4 * (4 + 2)) * 1 — multiplication is associative, so we can write it as 4 * 4 * 2 * 1? No, that’s 32.\n\nSo we must use parentheses to group the 4+2.\n\nBut 4 * (4 + 2) * 1 is acceptable.\n\nBut let’s compare with (4 + 4) * (2 + 1) — also acceptable.\n\nWhich one is better?

But we already used both 5s in 5/5.\n\nWait — let’s count:\n\nWe have: 6, 5, 5, 1.\n\nIf we do: (6 - 5/5) — that uses 6, 5, 5 — and we still have 1 left.\n\nSo (6 - 5/5) * 1 = 5 * 1 = 5 — not 24.\n\n(6 - 5/5) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 — no.\n\n(6 + 5/5) * 1 = (6 + 1) * 1 = 7 — no.\n\n(6 * 5) - (5 + 1) = 30 - 6 = 24 — oh! That’s also valid.\n\nLet’s check:\n\n6 * 5 = 30  \n5 + 1 = 6  \n30 - 6 = 24\n\nAnd we used: 6, 5, 5, 1 — each once.\n\nPerfect!\n\nSo: 6 * 5 - (5 + 1)\n\nThis is also a valid expression.\n\nWe can write it without parentheses: 6 * 5 - 5 - 1 — same as before.\n\nBut 6 * 5 - (5 + 1) is also fine.\n\nBoth work.\n\nLet’s pick one.\n\nI’ll go with: 6 * 5 - 5 - 1\n\nBut to be safe, let’s confirm:\n\n6 * 5 = 30  \n30 - 5 = 25  \n25 - 1 = 24 — correct.\n\nAnswer: 6 * 5 - 5 - 1\n\nBut wait — the problem says \"you can only use each number once\" — we are using 6, 5, 5, 1 — yes.\n\nAnd operators: *, -, - — allowed.\n\nSo it’s fine.\n\nAnother solution: (5 + 5) * 2.4 — but we don’t have 2.4.\n\nOr: (6 - 1) * (5 - 5/5) — 5/5 = 1, 5 - 1 = 4, 6 - 1 = 5, 5 * 4 = 20 — no.\n\nWait — 5 * 5 = 25, then 25 - 6 = 19, 19 + 1 = 20 — no.\n\nSo I think 6 * 5 - 5 - 1 is the simplest.\n\nBut let me see if we can write it with parentheses to avoid ambiguity.\n\nActually, 6 * 5 - 5 - 1 is unambiguous because subtraction is left-associative.\n\nBut to be safe, we can write: (6 * 5) - 5 - 1\n\nBut the problem doesn’t require parentheses.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: 5 * 6 - 5 - 1 — same thing.\n\nI think it’s fine.\n\nFinal answer: 6 * 5 - 5 - 1\n\nAnswer: 6 * 5 - 5 - 1\n", "prompt_tokens": 102, "global_seq_tokens": 2145, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 2043, "total_tokens": 2145}, "evaluation_config": {"model": "/inspire/hdd/project/multimodal-machine-learning-and-generative-model/public/models/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct", "api_extra_params": {}, "api_extra_headers": {}, "max_assistant_turns": null, "max_user_turns": null}}

We need to make 24 using each number exactly once, and only the operators +, -, *, /.\n\nLet’s try to think creatively.\n\nOne idea: 10 + 9 + 5 = 24, but we have an extra 1. So we need to use the 1 in a way that doesn’t change the value — like multiplying by 1 or adding 0.\n\nBut we can’t just ignore the 1. We must use it.\n\nWhat if we do: (10 + 9 + 5) * 1 = 24?

Correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could write it as: 10 + 9 + 5 * 1 — but that would be 10 + 9 + 5 = 24, but multiplication has precedence, so 5 * 1 = 5, then 10 + 9 + 5 = 24 — also correct.\n\nWait — is that valid? Let’s check order of operations.\n\nIn 10 + 9 + 5 * 1:\n\nMultiplication first: 5 * 1 = 5\n\nThen: 10 + 9 + 5 = 24\n\nYes — that also works.\n\nBut we must ensure that we’re not misinterpreting the expression. The expression 10 + 9 + 5 * 1 is equivalent to (10 + 9 + 5) * 1 only if we group it that way, but without parentheses, multiplication has higher precedence, so it’s 10 + 9 + (5 * 1) = 24.\n\nSo we can write: 10 + 9 + 5 * 1\n\nThat uses all numbers: 10, 9, 5, 1 — each once.\n\nOperators: + and *\n\nThat’s valid.\n\nBut let’s check if there’s a more elegant or commonly accepted way — but this is fine.\n\nAnother possibility: (10 - 5) * (9 - 1) = 5 * 8 = 40 — too big.\n\n(10 * 1) + (9 + 5) = 10 + 14 = 24 — that’s also valid!\n\n10 * 1 = 10, 9 + 5 = 14, 10 + 14 = 24.\n\nExpression: 10 * 1 + 9 + 5 — but order of operations: multiplication first, then addition.\n\n10 * 1 = 10, then 10 + 9 + 5 = 24 — yes.\n\nBut we can also write it as: (10 * 1) + 9 + 5 — but that’s not necessary, since without parentheses, 10 * 1 + 9 + 5 = 24.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: 9 + 5 + 10 * 1 — same thing.\n\nAll are valid.\n\nBut the problem says “you can only use each number once” — and we are.\n\nSo multiple solutions exist.\n\nLet’s pick one.\n\nI’ll go with: 10 * 1 + 9 + 5\n\nBut to be safe, let’s write it without ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid any confusion, we can use parentheses: (10 + 9 + 5) * 1\n\nBut the problem doesn’t require parentheses, and the expression 10 + 9 + 5 * 1 is acceptable as written, because multiplication has higher precedence.\n\nBut let’s test with a calculator or logic:\n\n10 + 9 + 5 * 1\n\n→ 5 * 1 = 5\n\n→ 10 + 9 + 5 = 24\n\nYes.\n\nAnother expression: 5 * (10 - 1) - 9? 5 * 9 = 45 - 9 = 36 — no.\n\n(9 - 5) * (10 - 1) = 4 * 9 = 36 — no.\n\n(10 + 1) * (5 - 1) = 11 * 4 = 44 — no.\n\nWait — 9 * (5 - 1) = 9 * 4 = 36 — too big.\n\nWhat about 10 + 5 + 9 * 1 — same as before.\n\nSo I think 10 + 9 + 5 * 1 is acceptable.\n\nBut let’s see if the problem expects a specific format.

Let’s compute:\n\nFirst, 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThen 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nThen 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could also write: (4 + 2) * (2 + 1) = 6 * 3 = 18 — too small.\n\nOr 4 * (2 + 2) * 1 = 4 * 4 * 1 = 16 — no.\n\nOr (4 + 2) * 2 * 1 = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12 — no.\n\nWhat about 2 * (4 + 2) * 1 = 2 * 6 * 1 = 12 — no.\n\nHow about 4 * (2 * 2 + 1) = 4 * (4 + 1) = 4 * 5 = 20 — close.\n\nOr (4 * 2) + (2 * 1) = 8 + 2 = 10 — no.\n\nAnother idea: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1) = 8 * 3 = 24 — same as before.\n\nSo, 2 * 4 * (2 + 1) — that’s also valid.\n\nWe have two 2s — so using 2, 4, 2, 1 — same numbers.\n\nSo either 4 * 2 * (2 + 1) or 2 * 4 * (2 + 1) — both work.\n\nI think 2 * 4 * (2 + 1) is slightly more symmetric.\n\nBut either is fine.\n\nLet me pick one.\n\nI’ll go with: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n\nBut to make sure we’re using the numbers in the order given? No, the problem doesn’t specify order, just that we use each number once.\n\nSo it’s fine.\n\nFinal expression: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n\nBut wait — we have two 2s — one is used in multiplication, one in the parentheses — that’s fine.\n\nWe can also write: (2 * 4) * (2 + 1) — same.\n\nBut to be safe, let’s write it with parentheses around the addition.\n\nAnswer: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n\nBut let me check if we can write it without parentheses? No, because without parentheses, 2 * 4 * 2 + 1 = 8 * 2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 — wrong.\n\nSo we must use parentheses around (2 + 1).\n\nSo: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n\nYes.\n\nAnother way: 4 * (2 + 2) * 1 — 4 * 4 * 1 = 16 — no.\n\nOr (4 + 2) * 2 * 1 = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12 — no.\n\nOr 4 * 2 * 2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 — no.\n\nSo our solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n\nBut let me write it as: 4 * 2 * (2 + 1) — same thing.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI’ll go with 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n\nBut to be consistent, perhaps use the numbers in the order they appear? The problem doesn’t specify order.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I’ll write it as: (2 * 4) * (2 + 1) — but that’s not necessary.\n\nActually, in the expression 2 * 4 * (2 + 1), it’s clear.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nAnswer: 2 * 4 * (2 + 1)\n", "prompt_tokens": 102, "global_seq_tokens": 1565, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 102, "completion_tokens": 1463, "total_tokens": 1565}, "evaluation_config": {"model": "/inspire/hdd/project/multimodal-machine-learning-and-generative-model/public/models/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct", "api_extra_params": {}, "api_extra_headers": {}, "max_assistant_turns": null, "max_user_turns": null}}
