## Description
Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) seeks to determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. On the left side of the image, the city points and paths are visualized, while the right side shows the corresponding distance matrix.

## Submission Format
The answer should be an ordered sequence of city IDs representing the route taken by the salesman. The answer should be in the following format: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]. Note that the answer should not contain repeated cities (except for the start and end city), and the first and last city must be the same (representing the return to the starting city).

## Example Input
```
0: {1: 10, 2: 15, 3: 20}
1: {0: 10, 2: 35, 3: 25}
2: {0: 15, 1: 35, 3: 30}
3: {0: 20, 1: 25, 2: 30}
```

## Example Output
```
Answer: [0, 1, 3, 2, 0]
```
